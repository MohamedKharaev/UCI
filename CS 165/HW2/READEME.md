The files seen here are different versions of various sorts.
All were written in C++ and were used to find differences in the runtimes
of these algorithms when run with different distributions of varying sizes.

The sorts being tested are Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort,
and a Hybrid Sort.

Running project2 will show the results of each sort on a uniform distribution set,
an almost sorted distribution set, and a reverse distribution set. The sizes of these 
sets are [100, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000, 25000, 50000].

The PDF shows these results in graphs. These graphs were generated using
python's library matplotlib, which can be see at project2.py
